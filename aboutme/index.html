    <p>Hello there folks! I love so much listen music while i take a break outside with my longboard. I like spend hours reading a book and learning something from another language.</p›
    <p>I am married with a amazing girl who has beceome the best mom of our little and crazy toddler. Now I live in Utah.</p>
    <p>I'm Deaf and recently I discovered the great world of sign language</p>
    <p>I'm so happy to be able to take this opportunity to study through byu online. This is a big bless. There is not much opportunities as a deaf person.</p>
